{:#spec}

Vega-Lite specifications are JSON objects that describe a diverse range of interactive visualizations.  The simplest form of specification is a specification of a [single view](#single), which describes a view that uses a single [mark type](mark.html) to visualize the data.  Besides using a single view specification as a standalone visualization, Vega-Lite also provides operators for composing multiple view specifications into a layered or multi-view specification.
These operators include [`layer`](layer.html), [`facet`](facet.html), [`concat`](concat.html), [`repeat`](repeat.html).

{:#common}
## Common Properties of Specifications

All view specifications in Vega-Lite can contain the following properties:

{% include table.html props="name,description,title,data,transform" source="TopLevelFacetedUnitSpec" %}

## Top-Level Specifications
{:top-level-spec}

In addition to the [common properties](#common), any kind of top-level specifications (including a standalone single view specification as well as layered and multi-view specifications) can contain the following properties:

{% include table.html props="$schema,background,padding,autosize,config" source="TopLevelFacetedUnitSpec" %}


## Single View Specifications
{:#single}

{: .suppress-error}
```json
{
  // Properties for top-level specification (e.g., standalone single view specifications)
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v2.json",
  "background": ...,
  "padding": ...,
  "autosize": ...,
  "config": ...,

  // Properties for any specifications
  "title": ...,
  "name": ...,
  "description": ...,
  "data": ...,
  "transform": ...,

  // Properties for any single view specifications
  "width": ...,
  "height": ...,
  "mark": ...,
  "encoding": {
    "x": {
      "field": ...,
      "type": ...,
      ...
    },
    "y": ...,
    "color": ...,
    ...
  }
}
```

A single view specification describes a graphical [`mark`](mark.html) type (e.g., `point`s or `bar`s) and its [`encoding`](encoding.html), or the mapping between data values and properties of the mark. By simply providing the mark type and the encoding mapping, Vega-Lite automatically produces other visualization components including [axes](axis.html), [legends](legend.html), and [scales](scale.html). Unless explicitly specified, Vega-Lite determines properties of these components based on a set of carefully designed rules. This approach allows Vega-Lite specifications to be succinct and expressive, but also enables customization.

As it is designed for analysis, Vega-Lite also supports data transformation such as [aggregation](aggregate.html), [binning](bin.html), [time unit conversion](timeunit.html), [filtering](transform.html), and [sorting](sort.html).

To summarize, a single-view specification in Vega-Lite can have the following properties (in addition to [common properties of a specification](#common)):

{% include table.html props="width,height,selection,mark,encoding" source="TopLevelFacetedUnitSpec" %}

## Layered and Multi-view Specifications

To create layered and multi-view graphics, please refer to the following pages:

- [`layer`](layer.html)
- [`facet`](facet.html)
- [`concat`](concat.html)
- [`repeat`](repeat.html)



{:#config}
## View Configuration

{: .suppress-error}
```json
// Top-level View Specification
{
  ...,
  "config": {          // Configuration Object
    "view": { ... },   // - View Configuration
    ...
  }
}
```

The style of a single view visualization can be customized by specifying the `view ` property of the `config` object.

### Default View Size

The `width` and `height` properties of the `view` configuration determine the width of a single view with a continuous x-scale and the height of a single view with a continuous y-scale respectively.

{% include table.html props="width,height" source="ViewConfig" %}

**For more information about view size, please see the [size](size.html) documentation.**

### View Styles

{% include table.html props="clip,fill,fillOpacity,stroke,strokeOpacity,strokeWidth,strokeDash,strokeDashOffset" source="ViewConfig" %}
